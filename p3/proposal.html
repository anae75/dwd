  Proposal:<h1> A Total Control Lighting prototyping helper </h1>

  <h2>What is Total Control Lighting?</h2>

  <p>
  It is a string of LEDs for the Arduino.  RGB color and brightness can be individually set for each LED.  To save on data
  pins, the LEDs are wired in series and a chip attached to each LED forwards the color and brightness information to the
  next LED and so on.  In this way one can have dozens of LEDs individually controlled using only 2 data pins.
  </p>

  <h2>Why do you need a helper?</h2>

  <p>
  TCL strings are fun, but it can be a headache figuring out the indexes of each LED for a complicated lighting pattern.
  It's pretty easy if the LEDs are laid out neatly in a grid, but what if you want to sew LEDs on your T-shirt and display
  an animated smiley face on your back as you're walking through the Yard?
  </p>

  <p>
  My helper will display a canvas where the user can drag a string of LEDs to an arbitrary position (with lines drawn
  between them to show the wiring) and then go in and change the colors of each LED.  There will be support for simple
  animations by allowing the user to generate a series of frames.  When the user is done, the helper will output an 
  array of values that can be cut and pasted into an Arduino sketch.
