  <p> <h2>Welcome, commuter!</h2>
  </p>

  <p> "Lost on the MBTA" is a user-expandable online cartoon.  Your hero and his or her
  brave companions will go on an adventure into depths of the T.   Along the way you 
  may be asked to draw or add dialog to help the story along.  </p>

  <p> But be careful --even underground there are hidden cameras recording everything you
  do.  Even after you have completed your adventure, your character, drawings and dialog
  will live on, accompanying other commuters on their trek through the tunnels.  The
  companions you choose on your journey were once the heroes of someone else's story.
