<h1>Project 4 Proposal:  A Collaborative Web Cartoon </h1>

I propose to create a collaborative web cartoon. Users will create their own main
character to take part in a simple cartoon adventure, along with 2 other companion
characters.  In the course of the adventure the user will be prompted to add dialog or
drawings in response to situations in the story.  These responses will be stored in a
database for future use.  When a different user plays the story in the future, they will
see the responses and drawings of previous users incorporated into the story.

<h2>Program Flow and Supported Actions</h2>

The program flow will be as follows:
  <ul>
  <li> There will be a short (mostly static) introduction to establish the storyline.  </li>
  <li> The user will be prompted to create a new main character by drawing on an html5 canvas.  </li>
  <li> The user will be prompted to select companion characters.  The applicaiton will
  start with 2 "stock" characters but as more users play the adventure their main
  characters will be added to this pool of potential companions.  </li>
  <li>
    The user will view the main story.  The story will be mixture of narrative frames, in which
    characters are displayed along with dialog and prompt frames, in which the user is
    asked to provide dialog or drawings to help their character in the story.
  </li>
  </ul>

  <ul> 
  <li> User account creation, login etc, similar to project 2 </li>
  <li> Create a character </li>
  <li> Select companion characters </li>
